YITH WooCommerce Affiliates allows you to create affiliate profiles and grant your affiliates earnings each time someone purchases from their link.

== Description ==

Do you want to improve your sales by sharing advertising of your products and of your site on other blogs to get visibility? But, maybe, you have not the time and the patience to browse the web in search of the right ones? No problem, you can let your users share your products on their sites and blogs in exchange of a commission for each product sold. Don’t you know how to do? No problem, again: you are in the right place, because here you find YITH WooCommerce Affiliates that makes this for you in a few clicks. Try it and you'll see on your own how it works!

= Free Features =

* When a user visits the store with a refer ID in query string, the plugin saves the affiliate ID and credits commissions to him/her if this visit turns into purchase
* Refer ID will be stored in user's cookie for a time that can be set in admin panel; this way, even though visit and purchase do not happen during the same navigation session, commissions can be credited correctly
* You can credit commissions only to affiliates that have registered and have been enabled correctly
* You can create new affiliates directly from users registered to your site
* You can use a shortcode to allow affiliate registration
* You can set a general commission for affiliates for each order coming from their refer ID
* Commission status changes automatically each time order status changes
* The plugin manages automatically all totals concerning affiliates and updates them according to the status of commissions and orders
* The plugin calculates automatically refunds and decrements the total of affiliate commissions in case of refunds
* You can register payments that have to be made to affiliates
* You can handle basic reports that can be filtered by date
* You can customise parameters for the cookies managed by the plugin
* Affiliates can access their own dashboard, where they find all information about sales trend
* You can use the shortcode "Generate link" to generate links for taking users to your site with the correct refer ID

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Affiliates` from Plugins page

YITH WooCommerce Affiliates will add a new submenu called "Affiliates" under "YITH" menu. Here you are able to configure all the plugin settings.
